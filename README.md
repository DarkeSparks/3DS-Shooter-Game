# 3DS-Shooter-Game

A 3DS Homebrew made in a week. The project was made me as a test if I could program something for the 3DS in C. The game is my first game I fully finished. It's "Playable", "Fun", and "Works Perfectly". Although It has a lot of flaws, I'm very proud that I finished it.

You either need a hacked 3DS or Citra Nightly in order to run the program. 
You use the make file in the program to compile the code and build the project. 
Sorry if you die of heart failure because of my hacky code.
